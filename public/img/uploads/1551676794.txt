They see you as small and helpless
They see you as just a child
Surprise when they find out that a warrior will soon run wild
Prepare for your greatest moments
Prepare for your finest hour
The dream that you’ve always dreamed is
Suddenly about to flower

We are lightning
Straying from the thunder
Miracles of ancient wonder

This will be the day we’ve waited for
This will be the day we open up the door
I don’t wanna hear your absolution
Hope your ready for a revolution
Welcome to a world of new solutions
Welcome to a world of bloody evolution
In time-your heart will open minds
A story will be told
And victory is in a simple soul

Your world needs a great defender
Your world’s in the way of harm
You want a romantic life a fairytale that’s full of charm

Beware that the light is fading
Beware as the dark returns
This world’s unforgiving
Even brilliant lights will cease to burn

Legends scatter
Day and night will sever
Hope and peace are lost forever

This will be the day we’ve waited for
This will be the day we open up the door
I don’t wanna hear your absolution
Hope your ready for a revolution
Welcome to a world of new solutions
Welcome to a world of bloody evolution
In time your heart will open minds
A story will be told
And victory is in a simple soul
